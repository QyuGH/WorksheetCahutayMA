```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Use the dataset mpg
```{r}
#A. Solution on how to import a csv file into the environment.
library(ggplot2)

mpg_data <- read.csv("mpg.csv")
str(mpg_data)

#B. The categorical variables from the mpg dataset are manufacture, model, year, cyl, trans, drv, fl, and class. 

#C. The continuous variables from mpg are displ, cty, and hwy.
```

2. The manufacturer with the most models and the model with the most variations.
```{r}
#A. Code for grouping the manufacturers and to look for their unique models.
manufacturer_model <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarize(model_num = n_distinct(model)) %>%
  arrange(desc(model_num))

manufacturer_model

variations_num <- table(mpg$model)
variations_num [variations_num  == max(variations_num)]
```
