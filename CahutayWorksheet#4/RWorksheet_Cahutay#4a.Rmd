```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Data Frame about shoe size and height.
```{r}
#A.  
shoe_size <- c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0)
height <- c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 64.0, 70.0, 71.0, 72.0, 64.0, 74.5, 67.0, 71.0, 71.0, 77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 62.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 67.0, 73.0, 69.0, 72.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0)
gender <- c('F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M')

shoe_data <- data.frame(
  Shoe_Size = shoe_size,
  Height = height,
  Gender = gender
)
shoe_data
#output shows the tabular data of shoe size, height, and gender.
```

```{r}
#B. Subset by males and females
males <- subset(shoe_data, Gender == "M", select = c(Shoe_Size, Height))
males

females <- subset(shoe_data, Gender == "F", select = c(Shoe_Size, Height))
females
```

```{r}
#C. Mean of the shoe size and height.
mean_shoe <- mean(shoe_data$Shoe_Size)
mean_shoe

mean_height <- mean(shoe_data$Height)
mean_height
```

```{r}
#D. Yes, there is a relationship between the shoe size and height of the respondent because when the respondent's height is taller, their shoe size is also higher.
```


2. Factor a character vector months
```{r}
months_vector <- c(
  "March", "April", "January", "November", "January", "September", 
  "October", "September", "November", "August", "January", 
  "November", "November", "February", "May", "August", "July", 
  "December", "August", "August", "September", "November", 
  "February", "April"
)
factor_months_vector <- factor(months_vector)
factor_months_vector

levels(factor_months_vector)
```


3. Check summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector
```{r}
summary(months_vector)
summary(factor_months_vector)

#The summary of the months_vector data shows the structure about its length, class, and mode.
#The summary of the factor_months_vector shows the frequency of the months appearing in the dataset.
#Both of the results shows relationship and useful information with each other. The summary of the months_vector provides the overall structure of the data while the results of factor_months_vector provides useful information about the content of the data.
```

4. Create vector and factor for direction table
```{r}
direction <- c("East", "West", "North")
frequency <- c(1, 4, 3)

new_order_data <- factor(direction, levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_order_data)
```


5. Import excel file
```{r}
#A. Import using read.table()
my_file <- read.table("import_march.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

```

```{r}
#b. View the dataset. Write the R scripts and its result.
print(my_file)
```
